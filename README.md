e-school
=====

e-school is created to maintain centralized utlilities which are more popular across opensource industry. e-school contains different repositories specific to use case and opensource utilities will be linked and rated into to e-school repositories. 

The utiliies can be rated and discussed in opensource community with pros & cons.

# How to I find the code for a particular course?
The code for each course is separated by folder. You can determine which folder corresponds with which course by watching the "Where to get the code" lecture inside the course (usually Lecture 2 or 3).

Remember: one folder = one course.

# Why you should not fork this repo
I've noticed that many people have out-of-date forks. Thus, I recommend not forking this repository if you take one of my courses. I am constantly updating my courses, and your fork will soon become out-of-date. You should clone the repository instead to make it easy to get updates (i.e. just "git pull" randomly and frequently).

# Where is the code for your latest courses?
Beginning with Tensorflow 2, I started to use Google Colab. For those courses, unless otherwise noted, the code will be on Google Colab. Links to the notebooks are provided in the course. See the lecture "Where to get the code" for further details.
